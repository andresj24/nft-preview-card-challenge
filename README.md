## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

The most complicated part of this challenge was the positioning and changing the background color of the main image when placing the cursor over it, the positioning of the other elements was completely simple using flexbox.

### Continued development

I am going to focus on continuing to work on absolute and relative positioning in similar projects in order to completely master this knowledge.
